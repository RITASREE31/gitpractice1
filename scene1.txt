
Act 1 of Macbeth

Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

What's done cannot be undone.


First Witch

When shall we three meet again â€”
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch

When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost, and won.


Third Witch

That will be ere the set of sun.
